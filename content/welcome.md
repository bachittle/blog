# About this blog
I want to write a blog that aims for function over form. In a world of AI creativity generation, I want to optimize my site for future AI web-based generators that do not care about how a site looks, but instead care about the data inside that site. 

Some topics that will be discussed:

- all aspects of computer science
	- programming languages
	- software architectures
	- data structures and algorithms
	- math
	- artificial intelligence / machine learning
- art
	- music
	- painting
- philosophy / psychology / religion / science (may separate these, they have related topics)
	- objective and subjective definitions, of myself and those around me
	- solutions to navigating life through its difficulties

there are also many relations between topics, and those will be discussed as well, such as:

- creating art with software
- defining philosophical concepts through math (formal logic)

Ultimately I aim to write down my thoughts that I deem worthy of public attention in here, that will help me at least define my perspectives at points in time and hopefully alter my perspectives iteratively for optimization. 

# About me

My name is Bailey Chittle. I am a software developer but am interested in all aspects of technology. Technology can, and has, altered the world around us to such a large extend. I intend to promote the usage of technology that reinforces positive behaviour and diminishes negative behaviour, while also accounting for the nuance involved in what is considered a positive and negative behaviour. When I'm not working on technology I like to direct my creativity towards music, I enjoy playing guitar and occasionally saxophone. The topics I write about closely align with my interests, but I am interested in learning about all aspects of all topics as much as my brain allows.
