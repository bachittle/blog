<h1>About this blog</h1>
<p>I want to write a blog that aims for function over form. In a world of AI creativity generation, I want to optimize my site for future AI web-based generators that do not care about how a site looks, but instead care about the data inside that site. </p>
<p>Some topics that will be discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>all aspects of computer science<ul>
<li>programming languages</li>
<li>software architectures</li>
<li>data structures and algorithms</li>
<li>math</li>
<li>artificial intelligence / machine learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>art<ul>
<li>music</li>
<li>painting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>philosophy / psychology / religion / science (may separate these, they have related topics)<ul>
<li>objective and subjective definitions, of myself and those around me</li>
<li>solutions to navigating life through its difficulties</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there are also many relations between topics, and those will be discussed as well, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating art with software</li>
<li>defining philosophical concepts through math (formal logic)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I aim to write down my thoughts that I deem worthy of public attention in here, that will help me at least define my perspectives at points in time and hopefully alter my perspectives iteratively for optimization. </p>
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Bailey Chittle. I am a software developer but am interested in all aspects of technology. Technology can, and has, altered the world around us to such a large extend. I intend to promote the usage of technology that reinforces positive behaviour and diminishes negative behaviour, while also accounting for the nuance involved in what is considered a positive and negative behaviour. When I'm not working on technology I like to direct my creativity towards music, I enjoy playing guitar and occasionally saxophone. The topics I write about closely align with my interests, but I am interested in learning about all aspects of all topics as much as my brain allows. </p>
